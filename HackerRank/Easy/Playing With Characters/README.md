# Playing With Characters

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** N/A  
**HackerRank URL:** [Playing With Characters](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/playing-with-characters/problem)

## Problem Description

**Objective**

This challenge will help you to learn how to take a character, a string and a sentence as input in C.

To take a single character  as input, you can use `scanf("%c", &ch );` and `printf("%c", ch)` writes a character specified by the argument char to stdout

```
char ch;
scanf("%c", &ch);
printf("%c", ch);

```

This piece of code prints the character .

You can take a string as input in C using `scanf(“%s”, s)`. But, it accepts string only until it finds the first space.

In order to take a line as input, you can use `scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s);` where   is defined as `char s[MAX_LEN]` where  is the maximum size of . Here, `[]` is the scanset character. `^\n` stands for taking input until a newline isn't encountered. Then, with this `%*c`, it reads the newline character and here, the used `*` indicates that this newline character is discarded.

**Note:** The statement: `scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s);` will not work because the last statement will read a newline character, `\n`, from the previous line. This can be handled in a variety of ways.  One way is to use `scanf("\n");` before the last statement.

**Task**

You have to print the character, , in the first line. Then print  in  next line. In the last line print the sentence, .

**Input Format**

First, take a character,  as input. **
Then take the string,  as input.

Lastly, take the sentence  as input.

Constraints**

Strings for  and  will have fewer than 100 characters, including the newline.

**Output Format**

Print three lines of output. The first line prints the character, . **
The second line prints the string, .

The third line prints the sentence, .

Sample Input 0**

```
C
Language
Welcome To C!!

```

**Sample Output 0**

```
C
Language
Welcome To C!!

```
